## For filmmakers

OCS is relevant as a pre-packaged, tested collection of workflows. Instead of building individual workflows from scratch, you get a curated system that handles the model/node dependency hell.

The tradeoff: less customization than building your own workflows, but much faster to get running.

## Integration with Claude Code

No specific Claude Code integration exists for OCS yet. The standard ComfyUI MCP servers work since OCS runs on top of ComfyUI. The workflows can be loaded and executed via the same API.

Potential project: Create Claude Code commands (`.claude/commands/`) specifically for OCS operations.
